<feat><name>Arcane Charger</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one cantrip.</prerequisite><text>When you use your action to Dash, you can cast a cantrip with a range of touch by using your bonus action. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line and hit with your cantrip, you can either add a +5 bonus to the spell’s damage roll or push the target 10 feet away from you.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Arms Booster</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell.</prerequisite><text>You can channel the power of your spells into an ally’s weapon. By touching a weapon and expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an action, the weapon becomes temporarily magical for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. The weapon counts as magical and gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls but gains no bonus to attack rolls. This effect ends when the duration expires, when you lose your concentration, or when you cast a spell that requires your concentration.</text><text>You must complete a short or long rest before you can use arcane infusion again.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Battlecaster</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell.</prerequisite><text>You are skilled at casting spells with a weapon in hand.
* You can use a weapon that you’re proficient with as a spellcasting focus.
* When wielding a magical weapon that you’re proficient with and that provides a bonus to hit and damage, you can also add that weapon’s bonus to damage rolls for spells you cast.
* You gain proficiency with a simple or martial weapon of your choice.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Careful Dragon Mask</name><prerequisite>The ability to invoke a dragon mask</prerequisite><text>You’ve mastered the ability to cast spells while wearing your dragon mask. With this feat, you no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls with spells and cantrips, and the targets of your spells don’t have advantage on saving throws, while you’re under the effect of your dragon mask.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Circle Spellcaster</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell.</prerequisite><text>You have learned to create a circular flow of magic between yourself and an allied spellcaster to bolster your spells. You gain the following benefits.</text><text>* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You can spend 2 hours (including during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. Once the bond is formed, you can work together to bolster one another’s magic. When one of you casts a spell that requires concentration, the other can use their reaction to help maintain the spell. If the caster must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on the spell, both of you make the saving throw. If either of you succeeds, concentration is unbroken. If both saving throws fail, you both lose concentration on any spells you are currently maintaining and you both take 2d6 psychic damage from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous bond breaks. Otherwise, it lasts until the end of your next long rest.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Dragonrider</name><prerequisite>Strength or Dexterity 15 or higher</prerequisite><text>You have trained to climb atop an opponent much larger than yourself, giving you an advantage in combat against enormous foes. You gain the following benefits.
* During your movement, you can try to enter the space of a creature at least two size categories larger than you. To do so, conduct a contest between your Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) opposed by the creature’s Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you win, you enter the creature’s space and are considered to be riding it. If you lose, you don’t enter the creature’s space and your movement ends.
* While you’re riding the creature, if it moves, you move with it. You also have advantage on your first melee attack against the creature on each of your turns.
* The creature’s attacks against a rider are made with disadvantage.
* The creature can dislodge you by using an action to conduct a contest between its Dexterity (Acrobatics) and your Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics), whichever you prefer. If it wins the contest, you are flung off the creature and land on your feet, unharmed, in an adjacent space of your choice.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Dragonsmith</name><text>You have studied the craft of turning components from a dragon’s body into weapons and armor. Working in conjunction with a master weaponsmith or armorsmith, you can create weapons and armor from the teeth, bones, scales, hide, or other parts of a dragon. The cost to create these items is ten times the normal cost of the item. The number and type of items that can be made from a particular dragon’s corpse is up to the GM, but considering how much violence must be inflicted on a dragon to bring it down, the amount of salvageable raw matieral is low; dragons don’t die from superficial damage.</text><text>Any type of melee weapon or bow can be made. The resulting weapon, in the hands of a proficient wielder, does an additional 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the dragon whose body was used to create the weapon. For example, a blue dragon dagger does 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 lightning damage.</text><text>Any type of armor can be made except padded or chain (shirt or mail). The resulting armor or shield, in  the panoply of a proficient user, provides resistance to the damage type appropriate to the source dragon. For example, black dragon scale mail gives its wearer resistance to acid damage.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Dual Dragon Aspect</name><prerequisite>The ability to invoke dragon wings</prerequisite><text>You’ve mastered the difficult ability to wear two different dragon aspects at the same time. When you switch from one aspect to another, the aspect you remove lingers for 1 round, provided its maximum duration hasn’t expired.

<feat><name>Eldritch Lifesaver</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell.</prerequisite><text>You’ve learned to cannibalize the power of your spells to reinvigorate your allies. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to heal yourself or an ally within 30 feet. The number of hit points healed equals the level of the expended slot. In addition, the target gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</text><text>You must finish a long rest before you can use eldritch lifesaver again.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Elemental Trapper</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell.</prerequisite><text>Your spells that do elemental damage leave a lingering danger on the battlefield. When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that does the chosen type of damage, you can choose to leave behind an elemental cloud that fills the same area as the original spell. Spells that target individuals create a 5-foot-diameter cloud in the target’s space. The cloud is stationary and lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures that end their turn inside an elemental cloud take damage of the cloud’s type equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + the level of the spell slot expended when the spell was cast.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Fearsome Dragon Mask</name><prerequisite>The ability to invoke a dragon mask</prerequisite><text>You can manipulate the visage of your dragon mask to be a terrifying sight to your foes. Any target struck by your mask’s bite attack must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If you augmented the attack with a spell slot, the frightened condition lasts an additional number of rounds = the level of the expended spell slot.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Find the Titan’s Weakness</name><text>You can spot the weaknesses in a foe’s defenses. You gain the following benefits.
* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* As an action, you analyze the defenses of one Large or larger creature you can see. Your next attack against that creature is made with advantage, and the attack scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Fortifying Healer</name><prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell</prerequisite><text>Your healing magic is augmented by the fortifying magic of resolute bravery. If you target one or more allies with a spell that allows them to regain hit points, those allies are immune to being frightened for a number of rounds = the level of the healing spell. In addition, one ally who healed hit points (your choice) gains inspiration. You must complete a short or long rest before you can grant inspiration again.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Heavenly Scribe</name><text>Prerequisite: Intelligence 13</text><text>You have discovered the name of an angel and deciphered the means to invoke a sliver of its power. You gain the following benefits:</text><text>* You learn the Celestial language if you don’t already know it.

* You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track a creature overland or to forage for food and water.
* When you finish a long rest within 1 mile of a ley line, you gain inspiration. If unused, this inspiration fades away after your next long rest.
* When you finish a long rest within 1 mile of a ley line, you can infuse ley energy into a token in your possession. If you make a saving throw while you have the infused token in your possession, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add the result to your saving throw. You can trigger this ability after rolling the d20 but before success or failure is revealed. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a long rest.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Ley Initiate</name><prerequisite>Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher</prerequisite><text>You see ley lines and can draw on their power. You gain the following benefits:

You must complete a long rest before merciful caster can be used again.</text></feat>
<feat><name>Negotiator</name><text>You have honed the knack of the deal and counter-deal, perhaps by crossing words with creatures used to getting the upper hand in negotiations. You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* When you attempt to convince a creature to engage in a course of action or to change its attitude with a Charisma (Persuasion) check and fail, you can retry the check on your next turn with disadvantage.
* When you purchase a good or service, you can attempt an opposed Charisma (Persuasion) check versus the seller’s Wisdom (Insight). If you win the contest, you secure a 10 percent discount on the transaction. Once you use this feature on a given individual, you can’t use it on them again for one week.
* During downtime, when you pay for lifestyle expenses, they are halved.</text></feat>

Your spells with a duration of concentration remain in effect after you lose concentration until the start of your next turn.

After activating this ability twice, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.
* Ring wardens and others who respect the traditions of ring magic are favorably disposed toward you. Their starting attitude toward you automatically improves by one step, and you have advantage on Charisma checks related to social interaction with such creatures.</text></feat>

Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.

Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than serve, guards abandon their posts.

Grasp of the tupilak remains effective for 1 hour or until it’s triggered. When you make a successful melee attack, besides doing normal melee damage, the target takes an additional 2d4 necrotic damage and one or more of the defender’s spell slots are transferred to you, for you to use as your own. Roll 1d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest level possible are transferred before lower-level slots.</text><text>For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you receive a 3rd-level slot plus a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available. You can steal either arcane or divine spell slots, at your preference. Crucially, however, spell slots can be stolen only from casters who prepare spells in advance. If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all its 1st and 2nd-level spell slots—then grasp of the tupilak has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is higher than you’re able to use, treat it as your highest-level slot.</text><text>A spellcaster who’s been affected by grasp of the tupilak can’t recover stolen spell slots until the stolen slot is used, you take a long rest, or they receive remove curse, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

The target takes additional fire damage at the start of each of your next three turns, beginning at 4d6, then 2d6, and then 1d6. The additional damage can be avoided if the target or an ally within 5 feet of the target scrapes off the lava. This is done by spending an action to make a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spellcasting save DC. The spell ends if the heated sling stone isn’t used immediately.</text><classes>Wizard</classes></spell>

Images behave exactly as those created with mirror image, with the exceptions described here. These images remain in your space, acting as mirror image, until you move or until you choose to have them move by themselves. When you move, your images can stay with you, or they can move an equal distance in any direction you want, at up to your speed. If you have a fly, climb, or burrow speed, your images do as well. You can also cause some images to move away while others remain in your space, or you can remain where you are and cause some or all images to move without you. All images must remain within 150 feet of you. Images that remain in your space can be destroyed by any attack directed against you, as with mirror image. Images away from your space can be destroyed by attacks that could hit them mistakenly, but not by attacks that can only target your space; a melee attack from an attacker adjacent to you can&apos;t hit an image that&apos;s 20 feet away, for example. If you have three or more duplicates, an attack hits a duplicate if you roll 6 or higher on a d20. With two duplicates, an attack hits a duplicate if you roll 8 or higher, and with one duplicate, you must roll 11 or higher.</text><text>While in your space, the images mimic your movements, sounds, and actions perfectly. Images in other squares perform logical alternative actions that you dictate in a completely believable manner. They can appear to make melee attacks (always narrowly missing), cast a spell with no visible effect, drink a potion, and so on. They can&apos;t produce illusory spell effects or interact with objects that you don’t have. The figments can move out of your line of sight. Their movement draws opportunity attacks as normal.</text><text>Finally, once per spell casting, you can exchange places via teleportation with one figment. You can do this as a bonus action on your turn or as a reaction to a successful attack that hits you. If you swap positions as a reaction, you take no damage and the figment is destroyed instead.</text><text>An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled.

If the gug takes 75 points of damage in a single turn, the swallowed creature is expelled and falls prone next to the gug. When the gug dies, a swallowed creature can crawl from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement.</text></legendary><legendary><name>Throw</name><text>The gug throws one creature it has grappled. The creature is thrown a distance of 2d4 times 10 feet in the direction the gug chooses, and takes 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage (plus falling damage if they are thrown into a chasm or off a cliff). A gug can throw a creature up to Large size. Small creatures are thrown twice as far, but the damage is the same.</text></legendary></monster>

Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws, and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With thief’s tools and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.
* Choke Bomb. This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that’s in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.
* Poisoned Sliver. A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
* Skullpopper. This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; Hit: 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.
* Slingsnare. A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.</text></trait><action><name>Dagger</name><text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

If the zaratan takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the zaratan must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the zaratan. If the zaratan dies, swallowed creatures are no longer restrained and can escape by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text></action><legendary><name>Move</name><text>The zaratan moves up to half its speed.</text></legendary><legendary><name>Swipe</name><text>The zaratan makes one flipper attack.</text></legendary><legendary><name>Consume (2 actions)</name><text>The zaratan makes one bite attack or uses Swallow.</text></legendary></monster>
